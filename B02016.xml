            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Although We have already written Our minde to You Our Counſell: yet upon our ſecond thoughts, ariſing eſpecially from ſome bad rumors, coming to Our knowledge, We finde it neceſſarie, both for Our ſelfe, and for the good of that Our kingdome, to declare, and make known both Our diſpoſition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires more fully.</p>
            <p>Wee know and feele the charge to be great, and the place to bee high, wherein God (the King of kings) hath placed Us, and that We muſt render an accompt of all Our actions to him, who in his own time ſhall judge all men without exception of perſons. Wee have no other intentions, but by Our governement, to honour him by whom Kings reigne, and to procure the good of Our people: and for this end to preſerve the right and authoritie wherewith God hath veſted Us, and which by his Providence hath been derived to Us, by many Princely progenitors: in the which glorie that our ancient Kingdome, and native realme of <hi>Scotland</hi> doth participate.</p>
            <p>We did not require of you, that you ſhould ſit as Judges upon the affairs of another Kingdome. Wee only intended to have both Our ſufferings and Our actions, (as they are expreſt in many papers paſt betwixt Us and Our Parliament) made throughly known unto you: that ſince We have none beſides you whom we can acquaint with Our proceedings, you may clearly ſee that we have been ſo far from wronging Our Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> that We have given them all ſatisfaction, even above that which they themſelves in the beginning did expreſſe, or almoſt deſire: and as much as could well conſiſt with the ſafety of Our perſon and honour. We will not put you in minde of your naturall affection toward Us, which We know will rather be kindled then extinguiſhed by Our diſtreſſe: Nor of your Covenant, wherein you are zealous of Our greatneſſe and Authority, and which ſtandeth in that ſenſe wherein you did ſwear and ſubſcribe it: Nor of the many good lawes made in Our late Parliament (of which We hope the preſent and ſucceeding generations ſhall reap the fruits when We are dead and gone) Nor of the many promiſes made to Us, upon which We were willing to yeeld to ſuch things for ſetling the government of that Our Kingdome, in Our perſonall abſence, which neither could We have granted, nor would you have craved (as your ſelves did profeſſe) had Our greater affaires permitted Our reſidence amongſt you. And whereas We are moſt unjuſtly blamed and calumniated.

                  <item>1. That We are popiſhly affected.</item>

                  <item>3. That Wee intend to bring in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine forces:</item>

Wee heer to proteſt and declare in preſence of him who knowes the moſt ſecret of Our intentions and actions, that We are no wayes conſcious to Our ſelfe of the guiltineſſe of any of the ſaid aſperſions: And do take him to witneſſe Our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency therein, who only hath the priviledge to be the ſearcher of hearts. And if any after ſo full and plaine profeſſion ſhall diſtruſt this Our free declaration: We atteſt God, that the fault is in the malignity of their rebellious humours, and no wayes deſerved on Our part.</p>
